##A Twist on the Classic Snake Game

**Game Mechanic**
- Navigate the Grid using the arrow keys to turn your snake.
- Collect the Red Dots to have your snake gain segments.
- Avoid the other (yellow) snakes. Watch out! They grow as your snake grows!
- Enjoy being able to wrap around the grid when going off the edge.. but beware of snakes sneaking up on you!
